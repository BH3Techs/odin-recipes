    <h3>The Best Creame Mushroom Pasta in the Town</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
        <li>¾ pound fresh white mushrooms, sliced.</li>            
        <li>¼ pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced.</li>            
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste.</li>            
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced.</li>            
        <li>2 fluid ounces sherry.</li>            
        <li>1 cup chicken stock.</li>            
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream.</li>            
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme.</li>            
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh chives.</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon.</li>           
        <li>9 tablespoons freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain but do not rinse pasta; transfer to a large serving bowl and keep warm. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir white and shiitake mushrooms in hot oil with a pinch of salt until liquid from mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir garlic into mushrooms and cook for 1 minute; pour in sherry and cook until wine is nearly evaporated. Stir in chicken stock; season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour cream into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and simmer for 5 minutes. Mixture will foam and thicken slightly. </li>
        <li>Stir thyme, chives, and tarragon into mushroom sauce and turn off heat; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into sauce until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li> Pour 1/2 of the mushroom sauce over pasta; toss to coat. Top with remaining mushroom sauce and 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
